Define the scope:  Clearly define the scope of the architecture review, including the goals and objectives, the stakeholders, and the timeline.


Review the requirements: Review the requirements document to ensure that the proposed architecture meets all the functional and non-functional requirements.


Evaluate the architecture: Evaluate the architecture based on established design principles, such as modularity, scalability, maintainability, and usability.


Evaluate the risks: Evaluate the risks associated with the proposed architecture and determine whether appropriate risk mitigation strategies have been identified and incorporated into the design.


Assess the quality attributes:  Evaluate the quality attributes of the architecture, such as performance, security, reliability, and availability, and determine whether they meet the desired levels of performance.


Consider Future Needs: Ensure that the design is flexible enough to accommodate future changes and can support the organization's long-term goals.


Review the implementation plan: Review the implementation plan to ensure that it is feasible in the defined timeline and that all the necessary resources(tech stacks) are available. 


Review the testing strategy: Ensure that the testing strategy is well-designed and includes sufficient testing at all levels of the architecture.


Review the documentation: Review the architecture documentation, including the architectural diagrams, design specifications, and implementation plans, to ensure that they are clear, complete, and consistent.


Provide feedback:  Provide constructive feedback to the team, highlighting any strengths and weaknesses in the proposed architecture and providing suggestions for improvement.
